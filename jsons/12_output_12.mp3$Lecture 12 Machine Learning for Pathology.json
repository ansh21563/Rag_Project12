  "text": " All right, everyone. So we are very happy to have Andy Beck as our invited speaker today. Andy has a very unique background. He's trained both as a computer scientist and as a clinician, specialty is in pathology. When he was a student at Stanford, his thesis was on how one could use machine learning algorithms to really understand a pathology dataset, at the time using more traditional regression style approaches to understanding what this field is now called computational pathology. But his work was really at the forefront of this field. Since then, he's come to Boston, where he was attending in faculty at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. In the recent couple of years, he's been running a company called Path AI, which is, in my opinion, one of the most exciting companies of AI in medicine. And he is my favorite invited speaker. Every time he has an opportunity, he invites someone to speak. I think you'll be really interested in what he has to say. Great. Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I'm really excited to talk in this course. It is a super exciting time for machine learning and pathology. And if you have any questions throughout, please feel free to ask. And so for some background on what pathology is, it's like if you're a patient, you go to the doctor. And AI could apply in any aspect of this whole trajectory. And I'll talk about specifically in pathology. So you go to the doctor. They take a bunch of data from you. You talk to them. They get signs and symptoms. Typically if they're at all concerned, and it could be something that's like a structural alteration that's not accessible just through taking blood work, say like a cancer, which is one of the biggest things, they'll send you to radiology where they want to. The radiology is the best way for acquiring data to look for big structural changes. So you can't see single cells in radiology, but you can see inside the body and see some large things that are changing to make evaluations for, like if you have a cough, are you looking at lung cancer or are you looking at pneumonia? And radiology only takes you so far. And people are super excited about applying AI to radiology. But I think one thing they often forget is these images are not very data rich compared to the core data type. This is my bias from pathology. But radiology gets you some part of the way where you can sort of triage normal stuff. And the radiologists will have some impression of what they're looking at. And often that's the bottom line in the radiology report is impression concerning for cancer or impression likely benign but not sure or impression totally benign. And that will also guide subsequent decisions. But if there's some concern that something serious is going on, the patient undergoes a pretty serious procedure, which is a tissue biopsy. So pathology requires tissue to do what I'm going to talk about, which is surgical pathology that requires tissue specimens. There's also blood based things. But then this is the diagnosis where you're starting to say, is this cancer or is this not cancer? And that report by itself can really guide subsequent decisions, which could be no further treatment or a big surgery or a big decision about chemotherapy and radiotherapy. So this is one area where you really want to incorporate data in the most effective way to reduce errors, to increase standardization, and to really inform the best treatment decision for each patient based on the characteristics of their disease. And the one thing about pathology that's pretty interesting is it's super visual. And this is just a kind of random sampling of some of the types of different imagery that pathologists are looking at every day. I think this is one thing that draws people to the specialty is, as I was saying, in radiology you're sort of looking at an impression of what might be happening based on sending different types of images and acquiring the data and sort of trying to estimate what's going on. Whereas here you're actually staining pieces of tissue and looking by eye at actual individual cells. You can look within cells. You can look at how populations of cells are being organized. And for many diseases this still represents sort of the core data type that defines what's going on. And is this something with a serious prognosis that requires, say, surgery? Or is this something that's totally benign? All of these are different aspects of benign processes. So just the normal human body creates all these different patterns. Then there's a lot of patterns of disease. And these are all different subtypes of disease that all have different morphologies. So there's sort of an incredible wealth of different visual imagery that the pathologist has to incorporate into their diagnosis. And then there's, on top of that, things like special stains that can stain for specific organisms, for infectious disease, or specific patterns of protein expression for subtyping disease based on expression of drug targets. And this even more sort of increases the complexity of the work. So for many years there's really nothing new about trying to apply AI or machine learning or computation to this field. It's actually a very natural field because it's sort of laboratory based. It's all about data processing. What we take as input, things like images, and produce as output. What a diagnosis is. So people have really been trying this for 40 years or so now. This is one of the very first studies that sort of just tried to see, could we train a computer to identify the size of cancer cells through a process they called morphometry here on the bottom? And then could we just use sort of measurements about the size of cancer cells in a very simple model to predict outcome? And in this study they have a learning set that they're learning from, and then a test set, and they show that their system, as every paper that ever gets published shows, does better than two competing approaches. Although even in this best case scenario there's significant degradation from learning to test. So one, it's super simple. It's using very simple methods. And the data sets are tiny. You know, 38 learning cases, 40 test cases. And this is published in The Lancet, which is the leading biomedical journal even today. And then people got excited about AI sort of building off of simple approaches. Back in 1990 it was thought artificial neural nets would be super useful for quantitative pathology for sort of obvious reasons. But at that time there was really no way of digitizing stuff at any sort of scale. And that problem's only recently been solved. But sort of in 2000 people were first thinking about, you know, once the slides are digital then you could apply computational methods effectively. But kind of nothing really changed. And still to a large degree hasn't changed for the predominance of pathology, which I'll talk about. But as was mentioned earlier, I was part of one of the first studies to really take a more machine learning approach to this. And what we mean by machine learning versus prior approaches is the idea of using data-driven analysis to figure out the best features. And now you can do that in an even more explicit way with machine learning. But there's sort of a progression from measuring one or two things in a very tedious way on very small data sets to I'd say this way where you're using some traditional regression-based machine learning to measure larger numbers of features. And then using things like those associations of those features with patient outcome to focus your analyses on the most important ones. And the challenging machine learning task here and really one of the core tasks in pathology is image processing. So how do we train computers to sort of have the knowledge of what is being looked at that any pathologist would want to have? And there's a few basic things you'd want to train the computer to do, which is, for example, identify where's the cancer, where's the stroma, where are the cancer cells, where are the fibroblasts, et cetera. And then once you train a machine learning-based system to identify those things, you can then extract lots of quantitative phenotypes out of the images. And this is all using human-engineered features to measure all of the different characteristics of what's going on in an image. And machine learning is being used here to create those features. And then we use other regression-based methods to associate these features with things like clinical outcome. And in this work, we show that by taking a data-driven approach, you begin to focus on things like what's happening in the tumor microenvironment, not just in the tumor itself, and it's turned out over the past decade that understanding the way the tumor interacts with the tumor microenvironment is one of the most important things to do in cancer, with things like fields like immuno-oncology being one of the biggest advances in the therapy of cancer. We're essentially just regulating how tumor cells interact with the cells around them. And that data is entirely inaccessible using traditional pathology approaches and really required a machine learning approach to extract a bunch of features and let the data speak for itself in terms of which of those features is most important for survival. And in this study, we showed that these things are associated with survival. I don't know if you guys do a lot of Kaplan-Meier plots in here. We saw it once, but taking us through it slowly is never a bad idea. Yeah, so I feel there's one type of plot to know for most of biomedical research, and it's probably this one. And it's extremely simple. So it's really just an empirical distribution of how patients are doing over time. So the x-axis is time. And here, the goal is to build a prognostic model. I wish I had a predictive one in here, but we can talk about what that would look like. But a prognostic model, any sort of prognostic test in any disease in medicine, is to try to create subgroups that show different survival outcomes. And then by implication, they may benefit from different therapies. They may not. That doesn't answer that question. But it just tells you if you want to make an estimate for how a patient's going to be doing in five years, and you can subclassify them into two groups, this is a way to visualize it. You don't need two groups. It's a subgroup. But it's frequently used to show differences between two groups. So you'll see here there's a black line and a red line. And these are groups of patients where a model not used, trained, not on these cases, was trained to separate high-risk patients from low-risk patients. And the way we did that was we did logistic regression on a different data set, sort of trying to classify patients alive at five years following diagnosis versus patients deceased five-year diagnosis. We build a model. We fix the model. And we apply it to this data set of about 250 cases."
