  "text": " Unfortunately, I have a guest today, Dr. Adam Wright, who will be doing an interview-style session and will answer questions for you. This is Adam's sort of bread and butter is exactly how to translate this kind of technology into the clinic. He's currently in the partner system at the Brigham, I guess. But he's about to become a trader and leave us in Boston and occupy a position at Vanderbilt University, for which we wish him luck. But I'm glad that we caught him before he leaves this summer. OK, so quite frankly, I wish that I could tell you a much happier story than the one that you're going to hear from me during the prepared part of my talk. And maybe Adam will cheer us up and make us more optimistic based on his experience. So you may have noticed that AI is hot. So HIMSS, for example, is the Health Information Management System Society. It's a big, they hold annual meetings and consist of a lot of vendors and a lot of academics. And it's one of these huge trade show kinds of things with balloons hanging over booths and big open spaces. And so for example, they're now talking about AI-powered health care. On the other hand, it's important to remember this graph. So this is the sort of technology adoption graph. And it's called the hype cycle. And what you see here is that R&D, that's us, produces some wonderful, interesting idea. And then all of a sudden, people get excited about it. So who are the people that get most excited about it? It's the people who think they're going to make a fortune from it. And these are the so-called venture capitalists. And so the venture capitalists come in, and they encourage people like us to go out and found companies, or if not us, then our students to go found companies and figure out how to turn this nascent idea into some important money making enterprise. Now, the secret of venture capital is that they know that about 90% of the companies that they fund are going to tank. They're going to do very badly. And so as a result, what they hope for, and what they expect, and what the good ones actually get, is that that 1 in 10 that becomes successful makes so much money that it makes up for all of the investment that they poured into the 9 out of 10 that do badly. So I actually remember in the 1990s, I was helping a group pitch a company to Kleiner Perkins, which is one of the big venture capital funds in Silicon Valley. And we walked into their boardroom, and they had a copy of the San Jose Mercury News, which is the local newspaper for Silicon Valley, on their table. And they were just beaming, because there was an article that said that in the past year, the two best and the two worst investments in Silicon Valley had been by their company. But that's pretty good. If you get two winners and two really bad losers, you're making tons and tons of money. So they were in a good mood, and they funded us. We didn't make them any money. So what you see on this curve is that there's a kind of set of rising expectations that comes from the development of these technologies. And you have some early adopters, and then you have the newspapers writing about how this is the revolution, and everything will be different from here on out. And then you have some additional activity beyond early adopters. And then people start looking at this and going, well, it really isn't as good as it's cracked up to be. And then you have the steep decline, where there's some consolidation and some failures, and people have to go back to venture capital to try to get more money in order to keep their companies going. And then there's a kind of trough where people go, oh, well, this was another of these failed technological innovations. And then gradually, you start reaching what this author calls the slope of enlightenment, where people realize that, OK, it's not really as bad as we thought it was when it didn't meet our lofty expectations. And then gradually, if it's successful, then you get multiple generations of the product, and it does achieve adoption. The adoption almost never reaches the peak that it was expected to reach at the time of the top of the hype cycle. But it becomes useful. It becomes profitable. It becomes productive. Now, I've been around long enough to see a number of these cycles go by. So in the 1980s, for example, at a time that was now jokingly referred to as AI summer, where people were building expert systems, and these expert systems were going to just revolutionize everything. I remember going to a conference where the Campbell Soup Company had built an expert system that was based on the expertise of some old timers who were retiring. And what this expert system did is it told you how to clean the vats of soup, these giant million-gallon things where they make soup, when you're switching from making one kind of soup to another. So if you're making beef consomme and you switch to making beef barley soup, you don't need to clean the vat at all. Whereas if you're switching from something like clam chowder to a consomme, then you need to clean it really well. And so this was exactly the kind of thing that they were doing. And there were literally thousands of these applications being built. And at the top of the hype cycle, all kinds of companies like Campbell Soup and the airlines and everybody was investing huge amounts of money into this. And then there was a kind of failure of expectations. These didn't turn out to be as good as people thought they were going to be or as valuable as people thought they were going to be. And then all of a sudden came AI winter. So AI winter followed AI summer. There was no AI fall, except in a different sense of the word fall. And all of a sudden, funding dried up. And the whole thing was declared a failure. But in fact, today, if you go out there and you look at, Microsoft Excel has an expert system-based help system bundled inside it. And there are tons of such applications. It's just that now they're no longer considered cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence. They're simply considered routine practice. So they've become incorporated without the hype into all kinds of existing products. And they're serving a very useful role. But they didn't make those venture capital firms the tons of money that they had hoped to make. There was a similar boom and bust cycle in the 2000s around the creation of the World Wide Web and e-commerce. So e-commerce, again, there was this unbelievably inflated set of expectations. And then around the year 2000, there was a big crash, where all of a sudden, people realized that the value in these applications was not as high as what they expected it to be. Nevertheless, Amazon is doing just fine. And there are plenty of odd-eyed e-commerce sites that are in perfectly good operating order today. But it's no longer the same hype about this technology. It's just become an accepted part of the way that you do business in almost everything. Yeah? AUDIENCE 2 Speaking of experts, it seems that maybe rule-based systems? They were either rule-based or pattern-matching systems. There were two basic kinds. I think a week from today, I'm going to talk about some of that and how it relates to modern machine learning. So we'll see some examples."
