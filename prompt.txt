 This course is about the  machine learning for the health care which is conducted my the MIT professors.Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"part.003.mp3","number":"lec1","start":269.46,"end":287.1,"text":" And access to data is actually a really important one,  obviously.  So let's now move on to some examples  of how machine learning will transform health care.  To begin with, I want to really lay out the landscape here"},{"title":"part.000.mp3","number":"lec1","start":277.24,"end":291.92,"text":" over the next decade.  Of course, we're just guessing, but this is really guided by the latest and greatest in  research.  And then we'll close today's lecture with an overview of what's different, what's unique  about machine learning health care."},{"title":"part.000.mp3","number":"lec1","start":258.88,"end":277.24,"text":" So let's start in today's lecture by giving a bit of a background on artificial intelligence  and machine learning health care.  And I'll tell you why I think the time is right now in 2019 to really start to make  a big dent at this problem.  Then I'll give you a few examples of how machine learning is likely to transform health care"}]

what is it meant by machine learning for the health care what does that really mean??
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
