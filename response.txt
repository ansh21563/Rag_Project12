From the clips you shared, the course focuses on applying and evaluating machine learning in healthcare—connecting model outputs to real clinical use, grappling with interpretability, critically reading popular ML papers, and emphasizing proper validation (e.g., prospective studies). Here’s where to see those themes:

- Lecture 4 (lec4), 6:06–6:22 (366.16–381.96) — ~16 seconds
  Topic: Connecting ML results back to what clinicians will do with them; noting that interpretability challenges exist (and are explored further in follow-on courses).
  How to watch: Open Lecture 4 and jump to 6:06.

- Lecture 5 (lec5), 3:03–3:10 (182.72–189.54) — ~7 seconds
  Topic: Critical appraisal of widely cited ML papers—asking “what is this actually doing?” to probe true value and mechanism.
  How to watch: Open Lecture 5 and jump to 3:03.

- Lecture 5 (lec5), 9:59–10:00 (598.94–600.14) — ~1 second
  Topic: Importance of doing a prospective study for validation in healthcare.
  How to watch: Open Lecture 5 and jump to 9:59.

If you share more subtitle chunks, I can give a fuller, timestamped outline of the course content.
