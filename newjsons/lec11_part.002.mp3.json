Talk about pi? Sorry? Talk about pi? Pi is irrational, but that's not what I'm talking about. Well, so there's this principle of rationality that says that what you want to do is to act in such a way as to maximize your expected utility. So for example, if you're a gambler and you have a choice of various ways of betting in some poker game or something, then if you were a perfect calculator of the odds of getting a queen on your next draw, then you could make some rational decision about whether to bet more or less. But you'd also have to take into account things like how could I convince my opponent that I am not bluffing if I am bluffing, and how could I convince him that I'm bluffing if I'm not bluffing, and so on. So there's a complicated model there. But nevertheless, the idea is that you should behave in a way that will give you the best expected outcome. So people joke that this is homo economicus because economists make the assumption that this is how people behave. And we now know that that's not really how people behave, but it's a pretty common model of their behavior because it's easy to compute and it has some appropriate characteristics. So as I mentioned, every action has a cost, and utility measures the value or the goodness of some outcome, which is the amount of money you've won, or whether you live or die, or quality adjusted life years, or various other measures of utility, how much it costs for your hospitalization. So let me give you an example. This actually comes from a decision analysis service at New England Medical Center, Tufts Hospital, in the late 1970s. So this was an elderly Chinese gentleman whose foot had gangrene. So gangrene is an infection that usually people who have bad circulation can get these. And what he was facing was a choice of whether to amputate his foot or to try to treat him medically. To treat him medically means injecting antibiotics into a system and hoping that his circulation is good enough to get them to the infected areas. And so the choice becomes a little more complicated because if the medical treatment fails, then, of course, the patient may die. It's a bad outcome. Or you may have to now amputate the whole leg because the gangrene has spread from his foot up the foot, and now you're cutting off his leg. So what should you do, and how should you reason about this? So Pauker's staff came up with this decision tree. By the way, decision tree in this literature means something different from decision tree in, like, C4.5. So your choices here are to amputate the foot or start with medical care. And if you amputate the foot, let's say there's a 99% chance that the patient will live. There's a 1% chance that maybe the anesthesia will kill him. And if we treat him medically, they estimated that there was a 70% chance of full recovery, 25% chance that he'd get worse, 5% chance that he would die. If he got worse, you're now faced with another decision, which is do we amputate the whole leg or continue pushing medicine? And again, there are various outcomes with various estimated probabilities. Now, the critical thing here that this group was pushing was the idea that these decisions shouldn't be based on what the doctor thinks is good for you. They should be based on what you think is good for you. And so they worked very hard to try to elicit individualized utilities from patients. So for example, this guy said that having your foot amputated was worth 850 points on a scale of 1,000, where being healthy was 1 and being dead was 0. Now, you could imagine that that number would be very different for different individuals. If you asked LeBron James how bad would it be to have your foot amputated, he might think that it's much worse than I would, because it would be a pain to have my foot amputated. But I could still do most of the things that I do professionally, whereas he probably couldn't as a star basketball player. So how do you solve a problem like this? Well, you say, OK, at every chance node, I can calculate the expected value of what happens here. So here it's 0.6 times 995, 0.4 times 0. That gets me a value for this decision. Do the same thing here. I compare the values here and choose the best one. That gives me a value for this decision. So I fold back this decision tree. And my next slide should have, yeah, so these are the numbers that you get. And what you discover is that the utility of trying medical treatment is somewhat higher than the utility of immediately amputating the foot, if you believe these numbers and those utilities, these probabilities and those utilities. Now, the difficulty is that these numbers are fickle. And so you'd like to do some sort of sensitivity analysis. And you say, for example, what if this gentleman valued his living with an amputated foot at 900 rather than 850? And now you discover that amputating the foot looks like a slightly better decision than the other. So this is actually applied in clinical medicine. And there are now thousands of doctors who have been trained in these techniques and really try to work through this with individual patients.
