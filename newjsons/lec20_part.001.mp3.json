Now, people have observed for ever since human beings walked the Earth that children tend to be similar to their parents in many ways. And until Gregor Mendel, this was a great mystery. Why is it that you're like your parents? I mean, you must have gotten something from them that sort of carries through and makes you similar to them. So Mendel had this notion of having discrete factors of inheritance, which he called genes. He had no idea what these were. But conceptually, he knew that they must exist. And then he did a bunch of experiments on pea plants, showing that peas that are wrinkled tend to have offspring peas that are also wrinkled. And he worked out the genetics of what we now call Mendelian inheritance, namely dominant versus recessive inheritance patterns. Then Johann Mischer came along some years later. And he discovered a weird thing in cells called nuclein, which is now known as DNA. And in a study that he did, he found that there was a very interesting gene that was called nuclein. And it was a very interesting gene."
