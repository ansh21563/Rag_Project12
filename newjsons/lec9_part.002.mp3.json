But 2014 data shows that CPOE, for example, for medication orders is only being used in about 25% of the hospitals. And at that time, people were extrapolating and saying, well, it's not going to reach 80% penetration until the year 2029. So it's a very slow adoption cycle. Maybe it's gotten better. The other problem, and one of the reasons for resistance, is that it puts additional stresses on people. So for example, this is a study of how pharmacists spend their time. And so clinical time is useful. That's when they're consulting with doctors, helping them figure out appropriate dosage for patients, or they're talking to patients, explaining to them how to take their medications, what side effects to watch out for, et cetera. These distributive tasks, it's a funny term, mean the non-clinical part of what they're doing. And what you see is that hospitals that have adopted CPOE, they wind up spending a little bit more time on the distributive tasks and a little bit less time on the clinical tasks, which is probably not in the right direction in terms of what pharmacists were hoping for out of systems like this. Now, people have studied the diffusion of new medical technologies. And I think I'll just show you the graph. So this is in England. But this is the adoption for statins. So from the time they were introduced, statins is a drug that keeps your cholesterol low. From the time they were introduced until they were being used, essentially at 100% of places, was about 5 and 1 half, 6 years. So reasonably fast. If you look at the adoption of magnetic resonance imaging technology, it took five years for it to have any adoption whatsoever. And that's because it was insanely expensive. And so there were all kinds of limitations. Even in Massachusetts, you had to get permission from some state committee to buy a new MRI machine. And if another hospital in your town already had one, then they would say, well, you shouldn't buy one because you should be able to use this other hospital's MRI machine. Same thing happened with CT. But as soon as those limitations were lifted, boom. It went up and then continues to go up. Whereas stents, I actually don't know why they were delayed by that long. But this is for people with blockages in coronary arteries or other arteries. You can put in a little mesh tube that just keeps that artery open. And that adoption was incredibly quick. So different things get adopted at different rates. Now, the last topic I want to talk about before I, yeah? What happens in those areas where you just have spikes? What's the limit? So according to those authors, in the case of stents, there were some champions of the idea of stenting who went around and convinced their colleagues that this was the right technology to use. And so there was just an explosive growth in it. In the other technologies, in the MRI case, money mattered a lot because they're so expensive. Stents are relatively cheap. And in the case of statins, those are also relatively cheap. Or they've become cheap since they went off patent. Originally, they were much more expensive. But there are still adoption problems. So for example, there was a recommendation, I think, about 15, maybe even 20 years ago, that said that anybody who has had a heart attack or coronary artery disease should be taking beta blockers. And I don't remember what the adoption rate is today, but it's only on the order of a half. And so why this is a dirt cheap drug? For reasons not quite understood, it reduces the probability of having a second heart attack by about 35%. So it's a really cheap, protective way of keeping people healthier. And yet, it just hasn't suffused practice as much as people think it should have. All right. OK, so how do we assure the quality of these technologies before we foist them on the world? And this is tricky. So Johnny Anides, a Stanford professor, has made an extremely successful career out of pointing out that most biomedical research is crap. It can't be reproduced. And there are some famous publications that show that people have taken some area of biomedicine, and they've looked at a bunch of well-respected published studies, and they've gone to the lab, and they've tried to replicate those studies.

So the problem is that if you give me a big data set, and I start mining this data set, I'm going to find tons and tons of interesting correlations in this data. And as soon as I get one that has a good p-value, my students and I go, fantastic. Time to publish. Now, consider the fact that I'm not the only person in this role. So David's group is doing the same thing, and John Guttag's, and Regina Barzolay's, and all of our colleagues at every other major university and hospital in the United States. And so there may be hundreds of people who are mining this data. And each of us has slightly different ways of doing it. We select our cases differently. We pre-process the data differently. We apply different learning algorithms to them. But just by random chance, some of us are going to find interesting results, interesting patterns. And of course, those are the ones that get published. Because if you don't find an interesting result, you're not going to submit it to a journal and say, I looked for the following fact, phenomenon, and I was unable to find it. Because the journal says, well, that's not interesting to anybody. So Ioannidis is recommending that basically every study that anybody undertakes should be registered. And if you don't get a significant result, that should be known. And this would allow us to make at least some reasonable estimate of whether the significant results that were gotten are just the statistical outliers that happen to reach p equal 0.05 or whatever your threshold is, or whether it's a real effect. Because not that many people have been trying this. Yeah? AUDIENCE 2. Just in some way, you think this is due because of the size of some patients, or bias in the data set, or just purely randomness in the study? PETER SZOLOVITSZ-MARTINEZ It could be any of those. It could be that your hospital has some biased data collection. And so you find, in effect, my hospital doesn't, and so I don't find it. It could be that we just randomly subsampled a different sample of the population. So it's very interesting. Last year, I was invited to a meeting by Jeff Drazen, who's the executive editor of the New England Journal. And he's thinking about, has not decided, but he's thinking about a policy for the New England Journal, which is like the top medical journal, that says that he will not publish any result unless it's been replicated."
