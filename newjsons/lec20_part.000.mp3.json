Now, if you look up dropsy in a dictionary, how many of you have heard of dropsy? A couple. So how did you hear of it? Sorry? From a novel? Yeah. AUDIENCE MEMBER 2. Yeah, so they had dropsy in London. Yeah, I mean, I learned about it by watching masterpiece theater with 19th century people where the grandmother would take to her bed with the dropsy. And it didn't turn out well, typically, but it took a long time for those people to die. So dropsy is water sickness, swelling, edema, et cetera. It's actually not a disease. It's a symptom of a whole bunch of diseases. So it could be pulmonary disease, heart failure, kidney disease, et cetera. And it's interesting. I look back on this. I couldn't find it for putting together this lecture. But at one point, I did discover that the last time dropsy was listed as the cause of death of a patient in the United States was in 1949. So since then, it's disappeared."
