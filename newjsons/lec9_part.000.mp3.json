And what you see here is that R&D, that's us, produces some wonderful, interesting idea. And then all of a sudden, people get excited about it. So who are the people that get most excited about it? It's the people who think they're going to make a fortune from it. And these are the so-called venture capitalists. And so the venture capitalists come in, and they encourage people like us to go out and found companies, or if not us, then our students to go found companies and figure out how to turn this nascent idea into some important money making enterprise. Now, the secret of venture capital is that they know that about 90% of the companies that they fund are going to tank. They're going to do very badly.

So I actually remember in the 1990s, I was helping a group pitch a company to Kleiner Perkins, which is one of the big venture capital funds in Silicon Valley.

But that's pretty good. If you get two winners and two really bad losers, you're making tons and tons of money. So they were in a good mood, and they funded us. We didn't make them any money. So what you see on this curve is that there's a kind of set of rising expectations that comes from the development of these technologies. And you have some early adopters, and then you have the newspapers writing about how this is the revolution, and everything will be different from here on out. And then you have some additional activity beyond early adopters. And then people start looking at this and going, well, it really isn't as good as it's cracked up to be. And then you have the steep decline, where there's some consolidation and some failures, and people have to go back to venture capital to try to get more money in order to keep their companies going.
