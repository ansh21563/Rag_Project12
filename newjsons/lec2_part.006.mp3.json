    "text": " You're not television watchers. All right, that's pretty cool. So I was stunned, because as I was preparing this lecture and I had the next slide, it turns out this plays a role in one of the episodes that was broadcast about a week and a half ago. So in the 1850s, there was a big outbreak of cholera in London. And John Snow was a doctor who did this amazing epidemiological study to try to figure out what was causing cholera. The accepted opinion was that cholera was caused by miasma. What's a miasma? What? Bad air. Bad air. So it's bad air. Somehow bad air was causing people to get sick and die. And several hundred people died. Whereas Snow started plotting on a map of the area in London where these were concentrated where everybody lived. And what he discovered, interestingly enough, is that right in the middle of Broad Street, which is pretty much at the epicenter of all these people dying, was a water pump that everybody in the neighborhood used. And that water pump, its supply had become infected by cholera. And so people were pumping water, taking it home, drinking it, and then dying, or at least getting very sick. And he looked at this and he said, well, if we turn off that pump, the epidemic will stop. And he actually went to the queen, Queen Victoria, hence the tie-in to the television show, and convinced her that this was worth trying, because they didn't have any better ideas. And they took the pump handle off the pump. And sure enough, the cholera epidemic abated. Now, of course, the underlying problem was sanitation. And they didn't fix that. That took longer. But what's interesting is here is a 2003 study of the spread of West Nile virus. So this is mosquitoes that are biting people and infecting them with this nasty disease. And they actually used very similar techniques to figure out that maybe this was coming in on airplanes through JFK. So mosquitoes were hitching a ride on an airplane and coming into the US. We need to build a border wall against mosquitoes. There's also a very controversial practice that used to be used a lot by public health officials, which was to quarantine people. And so there are lots of examples. Anybody's relatives come through Ellis Island? Must be a few. So they were subject to quarantine. If you were sick when you arrived at Ellis Island and they didn't know exactly how sick you were, they would put you in a building and wait a month and see if you got better or if you got worse, and then decide whether to send you back or to let you in. So that was a pretty common practice. There's a famous story of typhoid Mary, who was a carrier of typhoid fever but was not herself affected. Unfortunately, she was a cook. And wherever she was employed, people got really sick. And eventually, the New York Department of Health forcibly, essentially, jailed her in some sanatorium in order to keep her from continuing to infect people. It's a very controversial case, as you might imagine. You don't have to go that far back. Here's a 1987 article from UPI from the Chicago Tribune. So Jesse Helms, who was a senator, was calling for everybody who has AIDS to be quarantined. So fortunately, that didn't happen. But the idea is still around to say, well, we're going to stop this infection by quarantining people. And then here's a recent report about the Ebola response in Africa over the past few years when Ebola was ravaging parts of that continent. And their conclusions are, it's controversial. Debated issues, significant risks related to human rights. Quarantine should be used as a last resort. Quarantines in urban areas are really hard. Mobile populations make it hard. And this is the most technical conclusion, that if you're going to quarantine a bunch of people, you have a huge waste disposal problem on your hands. Because if you have people who might have Ebola, you can't just take their garbage and throw it out somewhere. You have to dispose of it properly. So the last thing I wanted to talk about, hopefully mercifully short, will be paying for health care. So I remember reading about 20 years ago that if you bought a Chevy from General Motors, they spent more money on health insurance and health care for their employees than they did on the steel that went into your car. That's pretty amazing. And so why is this? Well, essentially, there's an insatiable demand for health care. Nobody wants to die except for the suicidal people. And so if I'm sick, I want the best care possible. And I want as much of it as possible. Because what is more important in life than continuing to live? So we also have gotten better at making drugs and better tests and so on. I remember when MRI machines became popular about 30 years ago. The state of Massachusetts, for example, had a commission that you had to convince them to be allowed to buy an MRI machine for your hospital. Because MRI machines are very expensive. And MRIs were, at that time, hugely expensive. And so they wanted to contain the cost of health care by limiting the number of such machines. Well, eventually, the cost came down. And so we're doing better. But if you read the newspapers, you see that drug therapy is very expensive. We have these wonder drugs for rare diseases or cancers that cost a million dollars a year to pay for your dosage. And so there is a high human motivation to do this. And not much pushback, except from insurance companies. But they just pass the cost on in insurance contracts. There's also waste. There are lots of stories about half of health care expenses are spent in the last year of somebody's life.

And that's the United States on top. So I've selected a few of these just to look at. There's the US on top. France, Germany, a lot of the European countries are roughly at that highest of the crowd level. Canada is down there. The UK is a little lower. Spain is a little lower. Israel is a little lower. Turkey is the lowest of the OECD countries in terms of percentage of GDP that they spend on health care. So well, that's OK. But maybe we're getting more for our money than these other countries.
