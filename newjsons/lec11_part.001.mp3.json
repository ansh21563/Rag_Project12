Well, a more sophisticated model is something like a naive Bayes model that says, if you have a disease, where's my cursor? If you have a disease and you have a bunch of manifestations that can be caused by the disease, we can make some simplifying assumptions that say that you will only ever have one disease at a time, which means that the values of that node D form an exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of values.

And so he developed Bayesian reasoning in order to make this proof. And so his argument was, well, suppose you're completely in doubt. So you have 50-50 odds that God exists. And then you say, let's look at miracles. And let's ask, what's the likelihood of this miracle having occurred if God exists versus if God doesn't exist? And so by racking up a bunch of miracles, you can convince people more and more that God must exist, because otherwise all these miracles couldn't have happened. So he never published this in his lifetime. But after his death, one of his colleagues actually presented this as a paper at the Royal Society in the UK. And so Bayes became famous as the originator of this notion of how to do probabilistic reasoning about at least fairly simple situations, like in his case, the existence or nonexistence of God, or in our case, the cause of some disease, the nature of some disease. And so you can draw these trees. And Bayes' rule is very simple. I'm sure you've all seen it.

And so if you remember when I was talking about medical data, there are things like the Glasgow Coma score, or the Apache score, or various measures of how badly or well a patient is doing that often involve adding up numbers corresponding to different conditions that they have. And what they're doing is exactly this. They're applying sequentially Bayes' rule with these independence assumptions in the form of logs rather than multiplications, log odds. And that's how they're doing it. OK. Very quickly, somebody in a previous lecture was wondering about receiver operator characteristic curves. And I just wanted to give you a little bit of insight on those. So if you do a test on two populations of patients, the red ones are sick patients. The blue ones are not sick patients. You do some test. What you expect is that the result of that test will be some continuous number. And it'll be distributed something like the blue distribution for the well patients and something like the red distribution for the ill patients. And typically, we choose some threshold. And we say, well, if you choose this to be the threshold between a prediction of sick or well, then what you're going to get is that the part of the blue distribution that lies to the right is the false positives. And the part of the red distribution that lies to the left is the false negatives. And often, people will choose the lowest point at which these two curves intersect as the threshold. But that, of course, isn't necessarily the case. Now, if I give you a better test, one like this, that's terrific because there's essentially no overlap, very small false negative and false positive rates. And as I said, you can choose to put the threshold in different places depending on how you want to trade off sensitivity and specificity. And we measure this by this receiver operator characteristics curve, which has the general form that if you get a curve like this, that means that there's an exact trade-off for sensitivity and specificity, which is the case if you're flipping coins. So it's random. And of course, if you manage to hit the top corner up there, that means that there would be no overlap whatsoever between the two distributions."
