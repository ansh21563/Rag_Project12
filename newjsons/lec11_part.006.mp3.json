Now, he bemoans this fact because he claims that people make too many decisions that they ought to be deliberative about based on these sort of gut instincts. For example, our current president. But never mind. So what Eric and his colleagues were doing was trying really to look at how this kind of meta-level reasoning about how much reasoning and what kind of reasoning is worth doing plays into the decision-making process. So the expected value of computation is a fundamental component of reflection about alternative inference strategies. So for example, I mentioned that QMR had these alternative questioning methods, depending on the length of the differential that it was working on. So that's an example of a kind of meta-level reasoning that says that it may be more effective to do one kind of QMR."
