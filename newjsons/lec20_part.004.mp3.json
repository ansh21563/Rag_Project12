This is called a Manhattan plot, which I think is pretty funny. But it does kind of look like the skyline of Manhattan. So this is all of your genes laid out in sequence along your chromosomes. And you take a particular phenotype. And you say, what is the difference in the ratio of expression levels between people who have this disease and people who don't have this disease? And something like this gene, whatever it is, clearly there is an enormous difference in its expression level. And so you would be surprised if this gene didn't have something to do with the disease. And similarly, you can calculate sort of different significance levels. You have to do something like a Bonferroni correction because you're testing so many hypotheses simultaneously. And so typically, the top of these lines is the Bonferroni corrected threshold. And then you say, OK, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, and this guy come above that threshold. So these are good candidate genes to think that may be associated with this disease. Now, can you go out and start treating people based on that? Well, it's probably not a good idea because there are many reasons why this analysis might have failed. All the lessons that you've heard about confounders come in very strongly here. And so typically, what by now we have is this."
