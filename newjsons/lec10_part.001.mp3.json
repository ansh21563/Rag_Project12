If you want to build a brand new risk model for who's going to have a myocardial infarction, you're probably not going to have any echocardiograms to be able to use for that because nobody is going to have paid for that to be collected in the first place. This is a problem. To be able to innovate, I'm going to keep on coming back to that because I think you're going to be shocked by the small sample sizes that we face in some of these things. Part of it is because if you just want to piggyback on what insurers are going to be willing to pay for to get your data, you're going to be stuck with only being able to work off the stuff we already know something about. Much of my work has been really trying to think about how we can change that. Just a little bit more and then we can get into a little bit more meat. The universal standard for how imaging data is stored is something called DICOM, so Digital Imaging and Communication Standard. At the end of the day, there's some compressed data for the images. There's a DICOM header, which I'll show you in a moment. There's lots of nice Python libraries that are available to be able to work with this data and there's a free viewer you can use too. Where do I get access to this? This has actually been an incredible pain. Hospitals are set up to be clinical operations. They're not set up to make it easy for you to get gobs of data for being able to do machine learning. It's just not really there. Sometimes you have some of these kind of data archives that store this data, but there's lots of reasons for why people make that difficult. One of them is because often images have these burned in pixels with identifiable information. You'll have a patient's name emblazoned in the image. You'll have date of birth. You'll have other attributes, so you're stuck with that. Not only is it a problem that they're there, the vendors don't make it easy to be able to get rid of that information. You actually have a problem that they don't really make it easy to download in bulk or de-identify this. Part of the reason is because then it would make it easy for you to switch vendors and have somebody else take over. They make it a little bit hard for you. Once it's in there, it's hard for you to get it out. People are selling their data. That's certainly happening too. There's a little bit of attempts to try to control things that way. Many of the labels you want are stored separately. You want to know what the disease is of these people. You have the raw imaging data, but all the clinical stuff is somewhere else. You have to sometimes link that. You need to get access there. Just to give you a little bit of an idea of scale, we're about to get all the ECGs from Brigham and Women's, which is about 30 million stored historically. This is all related to cost. Positron emission tomography, you can get about 8,000 or so. We're one of the busiest centers for that. Echocardiograms are in the 300,000 to 500,000 ranges archive. That gets a little bit more interesting. What a DICOM header looks like, you have some identifiers and then you have some information there. Attributes of the images, patient name, date of birth, frame rate, these kind of things are there and there's some variability. It's never quite easy. These different modalities have some different benefits to them. This is why they're used for one disease or the other. One of the real headaches is that the heart moves. The chest wall moves because we breathe and the heart moves too. You have to image something that has enough temporal frequency that you're not overwhelmed by the basic movement of the heart itself. Some of these things aren't great. SPECT or PET acquire their images, which are radioactive counts, over minutes. That's certainly a problem when it comes to something that's moving like that and if you want to have high resolution. You typically don't have...you have very poor spatial resolution for something that ultimately doesn't deal well with the moving aspect. Cornering angiography has very, very fast frame rates. That's x-ray and that's very fast. Echocardiography can be quite fast. MRI and CT are not quite as good and so there's some degradation of the image. As a result, people do something called gating where they'll take the electrocardiogram, the ECG, and try to line up different portions of different heartbeats and say, well, we'll take this image from here, line it up with this one from there, this one from there. I'm going to talk a little bit about that and about registration, but ultimately that's a problem that people have to deal with. It's a computer vision problem of interest. Preamble is almost done. Why do we even imagine any of this stuff is going to be useful? It turns out that the practice of interpreting involves a lot of manual measurements. People like me and people who should have trained for way too long find themselves getting little rulers and measuring various things. For example, this is a narrowing of an artery. You could take a little bit of calipers and measure across that and compare it to here and say, ah, this is 80% narrowed. You could measure the area of this chamber, the left ventricle, and you can measure what its area is and you can say, ah, its peak area is this, its minimum area is this, therefore it's contracting a certain amount. So we do those things. We measure those things by hand. The other thing we do is we actually diagnose things just by looking at them. This is a disease called cardiac amyloid characterized by some thickening. I'll show you a little bit more about that and some speckling here. People do look and say, ah, this is what it is. There is a classification problem that comes either at the image or video level. We'll talk about whether this is even worth doing. Yes? Is this with software or do you literally take a ruler and measure the area?"
