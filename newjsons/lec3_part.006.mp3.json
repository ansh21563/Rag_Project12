It's a small, it's a short story, not so short, short story. Nursing notes tend to be shorter. They run up to about 3,000 characters. This other set of nursing notes, which I think comes from the other system, is a little bit longer. It goes up to about 5,000. Doctor's notes are a little bit longer. Yet they go up to about 10,000, 15,000 characters typically. And there are various other kinds of notes. So I just wanted to show you a few of these. Here's a brief nursing note. So this is a patient who is hypotensive but not in shock. Patient remains on this drug drip at 0.75 micrograms per kilogram per minute. No titration needed at this time. Their blood pressure is stable at more than 100. The mean arterial pressure is 65, greater than 65. Wean them from this drug, presumably, if it's tolerated. Wound infection, so anterior groin area open and oozing. Moderate amounts of thin pink-tinged serous fluid. Patient stooling with small amounts of stool on something and dangerously close to the open wound, et cetera. So this is sort of the nurse's snapshot. She just went in, saw the patient. By the way, I say she, but probably a vast majority of nurses in Boston-area hospitals really are women. But there are some male nurses. And we'll record sort of a snapshot of what's going on with the patient. What are the concerns? In principle, this is going to be useful not only as a part of the medical record, but also when this nurse goes off shift and the next nurse comes on shift, then this is a recording of what the state of the patient was the last time they were seen by the nurse. In reality, the nurses tend to tell each other verbally rather than relying on the written version. I remember one time talking to a nurse in an intensive care unit in another part of the country. And I said, so whoever reads your notes."
