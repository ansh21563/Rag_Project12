So a program I'll show you in a minute had 400 or 500 diseases and thousands of manifestations. And the computational complexity of exact solution techniques for these networks tends to go exponentially with the number of undirected cycles in the network. And of course, there are plenty of undirected cycles in a network like that. So there was a program developed originally in the early 1970s called Dialog. And then they got sued because somebody owned that name. And then they called it Internist. And they got sued because somebody owned that name. And then they called it QMR, which stands for Quick Medical Reference. And nobody owned that name. So around 1982, this program had about 500 diseases, which they estimated represented about 70% to 75% of major diagnoses in internal medicine, about 3,500 manifestations. And it took about 15 man years of manual effort to sit there and read medical textbooks and journal articles and look at records of patients in their hospital.

And that company had expanded it to about 750 diagnoses and about 5,500 manifestations. So they made it considerably larger. Details are I've tried to put references on all the slides. So here's what data in QMR looks like. For each diagnosis, there is a list of associated manifestations with evoking strengths and frequencies. So I'll explain that in a minute. On average, there are about 75 manifestations per disease. And for each manifestation, in addition to the data you see here, there is also an importance measure that says how critical is it to explain this particular symptom or sign or lab value in the final diagnosis. So for example, if you have a headache, that could be incidental. And it's not that important to explain it. If you're bleeding from your gastrointestinal system, that's really important to explain.

And I'll show you what those are supposed to mean. And so for example, what this says is that if you're anorexic, that should not make you think about alcoholic hepatitis as a disease. But you should expect that if somebody has alcoholic hepatitis, they're very likely to have anorexia. So that's the frequency number. This is the evoking strength number. And you see that there is a variety of those. So much of that many man years of effort went into coming up with these lists and coming up with those numbers. Here are the scales. So the evoking strength, 0 means nonspecific. 5 means it's pathognomonic. In other words, just seeing the symptom is enough to convince you that the patient must have this disease. Similarly, frequency, 1 means that it occurs rarely. And 5 means that it occurs in essentially all cases with scaled values in between. And these are kind of like odds ratios. And they add them kind of as if they were log likelihood ratios. And so there's been a big literature on trying to figure out exactly what these numbers mean. Because there's no formal definition in terms of you count the number of this and divide by the number of that. And that gives you the right answer.

And then you do a scoring calculation based on those numbers. The details of this are probably all wrong, but that's the way they went about it. And then you form a differential around the highest scoring diagnosis. Now, this is actually an interesting idea. It's a heuristic idea, but it's one that worked pretty well.
