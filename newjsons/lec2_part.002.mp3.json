That seems a little suspicious. But nevertheless, methodologically, it's a way of doing it. OK, so how do you measure the quality of life? Well, there's this notion of the activities of daily living. So can you bathe and shower? Can you brush your teeth and groom your hair? Can you get dressed? Can you go to the toilet, clean yourself up? Are you able to walk, get in and out of bed, get in and out of a chair? Can you feed yourself? And then there are a bunch of instrumental factors, things like, are you able to clean your house?

So occupational is a funny term for it, because this typically applies to people who are retired. So it's not really an occupation, but it's the sort of things that you need to do in order to be able to have a decent life. Well, now there's an interesting valuation question. So if you look at the top right model, we actually don't have very good data on anything other than mortality. So mortality is who dies. So the blue curve there is the curve that you've seen before, which is of a cohort, how many people are still alive after a certain number of years.

So they're not in constant pain, and they're not immobilized, and they're not unable to do the things that I just listed on the previous slides. And then disability is when you really become incapable of taking care of yourself. And it typically involves moving into an assisted living facility or a nursing home or something like that, which is kind of a nightmare for many people and also very expensive for society. So as I said, the blue curve there is based on actual data for American females in 1980. The red curve is a hypothetical curve where I just assumed that the rate of developing a morbidity is about twice the rate of dying. And the green curve, I assumed that the rate of developing a disability is, I can't remember, I think three times as high as the rate of dying, something like that. So that's why those curves are lower, and they look approximately right, but we don't have good data on those. Now, the question that you have to ask is, how do you want to change this? So for example, suppose that we kept the same situation. We reduced mortality to 20% of its actual rate, but we kept the disability and morbidity rates the same as they are on the top left.

For one thing, it would say that we ought to have as much population explosion as possible, because then we have more people to integrate over, which doesn't seem sensible. Now, obviously, if we start packing the world so that it's super crowded, then the quality of life will go down eventually enough that adding more people is probably not optimal. But nevertheless, that doesn't seem like a real satisfying solution. How about less? It was popular about 10 years ago for people to write these sort of speculative books about how would the world look if half the people died, other than the trauma of the half the people dying. They were proposing that this would be some wonderful sylvan, sort of ideal, old-fashioned kind of world. I didn't buy that. And of course, we don't know of a good way to get there. Although it is true that in at least developed countries, birth rates keep falling to the point where populations are worried about underpopulation. The Japanese, for example, have very strict immigration policies. So you can't become Japanese if you're not born Japanese. And Japanese people aren't having enough kids to replace themselves. And so the natural population of Japan is falling into that."
