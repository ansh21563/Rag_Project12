But there's an extra bed in the pulmonary intensive care unit. And so they stick you in that unit. But you're still on the cardiology service. And so there are these sort of mixture kinds of cases that you still have to take care of. Transfers are when you get transferred from one place to another in the hospital. Imaging data. So I'm not going to talk about that much today. But there are x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI, PET scans, retinal scans, endoscopy, photographs of your skin, and stuff like that. So this is all imaging data. And there's been a tremendous amount of progress recently in applying machine learning techniques to try to interpret the contents of these data. So these are also very important. And then there's the whole quantified self movement. How many of you wear an activity tracker? Only about a third? I'm surprised at a place like MIT. So we measure steps and elevation change and workouts. And you can record vital signs and diet and your blood sugar, especially if you're diabetic, allergies, allergic incidents. There's all this mindfulness, mood, sleep, pain, sexual activity. And then people have developed this idea of N of 1 experiments, where, for example, I had a student some years ago who suffered from psoriasis. It's a proteic condition of the skin. And the problem is there are no good cures for it. And so people who suffer from psoriasis try all kinds of things. They stop eating nuts for a while, or they douse themselves with vinegar, or they do whatever crazy thing comes to mind. And we don't have a good theory for how to treat this disease. But on the other hand, some things work for some people. And so there's a whole methodology that has been developed that says, when you try these things, act like a scientist. Have hypotheses. Take good notes. Collect good data. Be cognizant of things like onset periods, where you may have to drip vinegar on yourself for a week before you see any effect. So if it doesn't do anything after one day, don't stop. And furthermore, if you stop, then don't start something new immediately, because you will then be confused about whether this is the effect of the thing you were on before or the new thing that you're trying. So there's all sorts of ideas like that. OK, so this is a slide from our paper on MIMIC3. And it gives you a kind of overview of what's going on with the patient. So if you look at this, I'm going to point with my finger."
