And at least if you're an optimist, you can believe these extrapolations that say, well, we could prevent 3 million adverse drug events at big city hospitals in the United States if everybody used systems like this. So the benefits are that it prompts with warnings against possible drug interactions, allergies, or overdoses. It can be kept up to date by some sort of mechanism where people read the literature and keep updating the databases that this is driven from. And it can do sort of mechanical things like eliminate confusion about drug names that sound similar and stuff like that. And so the leapfrog group, which does a lot of meta-analyses and studies of what's effective, really is behind this and pushing it very strongly. Potential future benefits, of course, are that if the kinds of machine learning techniques that we talk about become widely used, then these systems can be updated automatically rather than by manual review. And you can gain the advantages of immediate feedback as new information becomes available. Now, the adoption of CPOE."
