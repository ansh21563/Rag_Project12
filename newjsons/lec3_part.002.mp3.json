The averages there and the distributions look moderately similar. If you're coming from a skilled nursing facility, if you are in a skilled nursing facility, you're probably old, because younger people don't typically need skilled nursing care.

So just so I can see, is that there is a higher proportion of black African-American people in the population here as well, because the red is higher than the others? No, actually, I don't remember if I have that graph. I think this is cumulative. So most people are white, for whatever definition of white we're using. And I think it's only the increment that you see on top. All right, how about marital status? Well, according to this, it's bad to be single."
