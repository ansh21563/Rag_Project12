So it's an antiviral defense mechanism. And we're now figuring out how to use it to do gene editing. You may have read about this Chinese guy who actually went out and edited the genome of a couple of girls who were born in China, incorporating some, I think, resistance against HIV infections in their genome. And of course, this is probably way too early to do experiments on human beings because they haven't demonstrated that this is safe. But maybe that'll become accepted.

But what he's doing is a really great idea. So we'll see where that goes. And then there are these retrotransposons where pieces of DNA in eukarya just pop out of somewhere wherever they are and insert themselves in some other place in the genome.

It's like a mile of DNA in each of your cells. So it wouldn't fit. And so it gets wrapped up on these acetylated histones to produce something called chromatin.

And therefore, it's not clear how it gets expressed. But somehow or other, the cell is able to do that. So there's a lot yet to learn in this area. OK.
