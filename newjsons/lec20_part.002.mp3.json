So he said the specificity of a piece of nucleic acid is expressed solely by the sequence of its bases. And this sequence is a simple code for the amino acid sequence of a particular protein.

And then a few Nobel Prizes later, we began to understand some of the mechanism of how this works. And of course, how it works is that you have DNA, which is these four bases, double-stranded. RNA gets produced in the process of transcription. So this thing unfolds. An RNA strand is built along the DNA and separates from the DNA, creating a single-stranded RNA. And then it goes and hooks up with the ribosome. And the ribosome takes that RNA and takes the codes in triplets. And each triplet stands for a particular amino acid, which it then assembles in sequence and creates proteins, which are sequences of amino acids. Now, it's very complicated because there's three-dimensionality, and there's time involved, and there are rate constants. This is chemistry, after all. So again, a few more Nobel Prizes later, we have that transcription, that process of turning DNA into RNA is regulated by promoter, repressor, and enhancer regions on the genome.
