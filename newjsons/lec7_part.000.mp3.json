And then I'm going to talk about some conceptually very appealing but practically not very feasible methods that involve analyzing these narrative texts as linguistic entities, as linguistic objects, in the way that a linguist might approach them.

And so this is a lot of the bread and butter of how clinical research is done nowadays. And then I'll go on to some other techniques. So here's an example. This is a discharge summary from MIMIC. When you played with MIMIC, you notice that it's de-identified. And so names and things are replaced with square brackets, star, star, star kinds of things. And here I have re-replaced those with synthetic names. So Mr. Blind isn't really Mr. Blind. And November 15 probably really isn't November 15, et cetera. But I wanted something that read like real text. So if you look at something like this, you see that Mr. Blind is a 79-year-old white, white male. So somebody repeated a word with a history of diabetes mellitus in inferior MI who underwent open repair of his increased diverticulum on November 13 at some, again, that's not the name of the actual place, medical center. And then he developed hebatemisis. So he was spitting up blood and was intubated for respiratory distress. So he wasn't breathing well. So these are all really important things about what happened to Mr. Blind. And so we'd like to be able to take advantage of this. And in fact, to give you a slightly more quantitative version of this, Kat and I worked on a project back around 2010 where we were looking at trying to understand what are the genetic correlates of rheumatoid arthritis. And so we went to the research patient data repository of Mass General and the Brigham Partners Health Care. And we said, OK, who are the patients who have been billed for a rheumatoid arthritis visit? And there are many thousands of those people. And then we selected a random set of, I think, 400 of those patients. We gave them to rheumatologists. And we said, which of these people actually have rheumatoid arthritis? So these were based on billing codes. So what would you guess is the positive predictive value of having a billing code for rheumatoid arthritis in this data set? I mean, how many people think it's more than 50%? OK, that would be nice. But it's not. How many people think it's more than 25%? God, you guys are getting really pessimistic. Well, it also isn't.

They were created in order to tell an insurance company or Medicare or somebody how much of a payment is deserved by the doctors taking care of them.

So we said, well, OK, what if we insisted that you have three billing codes for rheumatoid arthritis rather than just one? And that turned out to raise the positive predictive value all the way up to 27%. So you go, really? How could you get billed three times? Well, the answer is that you get billed for every aspirin you take at the hospital. And so, for example, it's very easy to accumulate three billing codes for the same thing. Because you go see a doctor, the doctor bills you for a rheumatoid arthritis visit. He or she sends you to a radiologist to take an X-ray of your fingers, your joints. That bill is another billing code for RA. The doctor also sends you to the lab to have a blood drawn so that they can check your anti-CCP titer. That's another billing code for rheumatoid arthritis.
