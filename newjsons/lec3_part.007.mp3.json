And ODYSSEY hasn't handled clinical notice very well yet. Well, so what always happens is you say I'm going to adopt this standard asterisk with the following extensions. And that's probably what's going to happen. But it means that the central tables, the ICD-9 code tables and the drug tables and things like that, are likely to wind up adopting the formats of the ODYSSEY database. You should also know about this thing called FHIR, F-H-I-R, the Fast Health Interoperability Resources. So HL7 is the standards organization that had a tremendous success in the early 1990s in solving the problem of how to allow laboratories to report lab data back to the hospitals or the clinics that ordered the labs. And that character string with the up arrows and the vertical bars and so on that I showed you before that had LOINC encoded in it is that standard. That's called HL7 version 2. It's still in use very widely. They then got ambitious and suffered second system syndrome, which is they decided to build HL7 version 3, which I used to teach in a class here 10 years ago. But one of my friends who works for a company that helps hospitals implement that sent me a 38-megabyte PDF file that describes what you need to know in order to implement that system. And as a result, nobody was doing it. So FHIR is a gross simplification of that that starts off and says, if a doctor refers a new patient to you, what is the minimum set of data that you need to know in order to take care of that person? And FHIR tries to provide just that subset of all the data. It has become a standard mainly because after Congress spent $42 billion or so bribing people into buying these information systems, they got mad that the information systems they bought couldn't talk to each other. And so they called in on the carpet the heads of these IT companies, health IT companies."
