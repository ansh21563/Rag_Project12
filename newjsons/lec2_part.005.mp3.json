And they adopted this as a way of getting typically mortality data of what was it that people were dying of. And by 1920s, you've heard of ICD, ICD-9, ICD-10. So this is currently used as a way of classifying diseases and disorders. The International List of the Causes of Death was the first ICD back in, I think, the 1920s. And then it kept developing through multiple versions. In 1975, ICD-9 was adopted. In 2015, ICD-10. And these are under the control of the World Health Organization, which is now a UN agency, although I think it predates the UN, actually. And then we have ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, our US clinical modifications, that are an extension of the ICD-9 and 10 coding. And they are primarily used for billing. But they're also used for epidemiological research. And if you look at the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, they collect death certificates like this from all over the country. And so this is a person who died of a cerebral hemorrhage, which was due to nephritis, which was due to cirrhosis of the liver. And so you can use this kind of data to say, well, here's the immediate cause of death. Here's sort of the proximate cause of death. And here's the underlying cause of death. And so this is the sort of statistical data that we now have available. Now, do any of you watch the PBS show Victoria? Nobody?"
