And it's something that I'm going to return to throughout the semester. It's, again, something where I think policy can make a big difference. But luckily, here at MIT, the story is going to be a bit different. So thanks to the MIT IBM Watson AI Lab, MIT has a close relationship with IBM. And fingers crossed, it looks like we'll get access to this database for our homework and projects for this semester. Now, there are a lot of other initiatives that are creating large data sets. A really important example here in the US is President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative, which has since been renamed to the All of Us Initiative. And this initiative is creating a data set of 1 million patients drawn in a representative manner from across the United States to capture patients, both poor and rich, patients who are healthy and have chronic disease, with the goal of trying to create a research database where all of us and other people, both inside and outside the US, could do research to make medical discoveries. And this will include data such as data from a baseline health exam, where the typical vitals are taken, blood is drawn. It'll combine data of the previous two types I've mentioned, including both data from electronic medical records and health insurance claims. And then a lot of this work is also happening here in Boston. So right across the street at the Broad Institute, there's a team which is creating all of the software infrastructure to accommodate this data. And there are a large number of accruement sites here in the broader Boston area where patients, or any one of you, really, could go and volunteer to be part of the study. I just got a mail. I got a letter in the mail last week inviting me to go, and I was really excited to see that. So all sorts of different data is being created as a result of these trends that I've been mentioning. And it ranges from unstructured data, like clinical notes, to imaging, lab tests, vital signs. Nowadays, what we used to think about just as clinical data now has started to really come to have a very tight tie to what we think about as biological data. So data from genomics and proteomics is starting to play a major role in both clinical research and clinical practice. Of course, not everything that we traditionally think about health care data, there are also some nontraditional sources of views on health. So for example, social media is an interesting way of thinking through both psychiatric disorders, where many of us will post things on Facebook and other places about our mental health, which give a lens on our mental health. Your phone, which is tracking your activity, will give us a view on how active we are. It might help us diagnose early a variety of conditions as well that I'll mention later. So this whole theme now is about what's changed since the previous approaches at AI medicine. I've just talked about data, but data alone is not nearly enough. The other major change is that there has been decades worth of work on standardizing health data. So for example, when I mentioned to you that when you go to a doctor's office and they send a bill, that bill is associated with a diagnosis, the diagnosis is coded in a system called ICD-9 or ICD-10, which is a standardized system where for many, not all, but many diseases, there is a corresponding code associated with it. ICD-10, which was recently rolled out nationwide about a year ago, is much more detailed than the previous coding system, includes some interesting categories. For example, bitten by a turtle has a code for it. Bitten by a sea lion, struck by a macaw. So it's starting to get really detailed here, which has its benefits and its disadvantages when it comes to research using that data. But certainly, we can do more with detailed data than we could with less detailed data. Laboratory test results are standardized using a system called LOINC here in the United States. It's, again, every lab test order has an associated code for it. I just want to point out briefly that the values associated with those lab tests are less standardized. Pharmacy, national drug codes should be very familiar to you. If you take any medication that you've been prescribed and you look carefully, you'll see a number on it. NDC 0015347911, that number is unique to that medication. In fact, it's even unique to the brand of that medication. And there's an associated taxonomy with it. And so one can really understand in a very structured way what medications the patient is on and how those medications relate to one another. A lot of medical data is found not in this structured form, but in free text and notes written by doctors. And these notes have often lots of mentions of symptoms and conditions in them. And one can try to standardize those by mapping them to what's called the Unified Medical Language System, which is an ontology with millions of different medical concepts in them. So I'm not going to go too much more into these. They'll be the subject of much discussion in this semester, but particularly in the next two lectures by Pete. But I want to talk very briefly about what you can do once you have a standardized vocabulary. So one thing you can do is you could build APIs, or application programming interfaces, for now sending that data from place to place. And FHIR, F-H-I-R, is a new standard which has widespread adoption now here in the United States for hospitals to provide data both to downstream clinical purposes, but also directly to patients. And in this standard, it will use many of the vocabularies I mentioned to you in the previous slides to encode diagnoses, medications, allergies, problems, and even financial aspects that are relevant to the care of this patient. And for those of you who have an Apple phone, for example, if you open up Apple Health Records, it makes use of this standard to receive data from over 50 different hospitals. And you should expect to see many competitors to them in the future because of the fact that it's now an open standard. Now, other types of data, like the health insurance claims I mentioned earlier, is often encoded in a slightly different data model. One which my lab works quite a bit with is called OMOP. And it's being maintained by a nonprofit organization called the Observational Health Data Sciences Initiative, Odyssey. And this common data model gives a standard way of taking data from an institution which might have its own intricacies and really mapping it to this common language so that if you write a machine learning algorithm once and that machine learning algorithm reads in data in this format, you could then apply it somewhere else very easily. And the importance of these standards really can't be understated. The importance for translating what we're doing in this class into clinical practice. And so we'll be returning to these things in the next few slides."
