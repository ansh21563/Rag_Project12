And based on that, we determine a diagnosis. Now, do we determine a diagnosis? Maybe not. Maybe we guess a diagnosis. One of the things I learned early on working in this field is that doctors are actually quite willing to make guesses because it's so useful to believe that you understand what's going on. If you say, well, there's some probability distribution over a vast number of possible things, that doesn't give you very good guidance on what to do next. Whereas if you can say, oh, I think this patient is developing type 2 diabetes, then you're locked into a set of questions and a set of approaches that you might try. Now, when we come back to looking at machine learning, machines don't have the same limitations as people. And so for a machine to integrate over a vast number of possibilities is not difficult. But for a human cognition to do that is very hard. And so this is actually an important characteristic of the way doctors think about diagnostic reasoning. So then having made a diagnosis or made a guess, they plan some kind of therapy. They apply that therapy. And then they wait a while, and they see what happened. So if your diagnosis led you to a choice of therapy, you gave that therapy to the patient, and the patient got better, then you say, well, it must have been the right diagnosis. If the patient didn't get better, then you say, well, how did what happened to the patient differ from what I expected to happen to the patient? And that drives your revision of this whole process. So we, again, examine what happened as a result of the therapy. We gather more data. We interpret it. We come up with a revised diagnostic hypothesis. We come up with a revised therapeutic plan. And we keep going around this cycle. Now, that cycle happens very quickly if you're a hospitalized patient. Because you're there all the time. You're available. They're trying to do things to you constantly. And so this cycle happens on the order of hours or a day. Whereas if you're an outpatient and you're not dealing with some urgent problem, it may happen over a much slower period. It may be that your doctor says, well, we're going to adjust your drug dose and see if that helps bring down your cholesterol or manage your pain or whatever it is that he's trying to do. Or worse yet, we're going to try to convince you to eat more healthy food. And six months later, we'll see if your hemoglobin A1C came down, that you're less close to being diabetic. So the time scale is very different. But that process of continually reinterpreting things is a really critical feature, I think, of all of medical care. And if you look back, Alan Turing actually talked in the early 1950s about health care as being one of the interesting application areas of artificial intelligence. Why? Well, because it was an important topic. And he had the vision that says, as we start getting more data about health care, we're going to be able to build the kinds of models that we're going to be talking about in this class. But a lot of the early work took a kind of one-shot approach. So they said, well, we're going to solve the diagnostic problem. So we're going to take a snapshot of a patient."
